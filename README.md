Innovating Quiz Experiences with Whisper AI and Gradio: The KBK Quiz App

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, integrating cutting-edge AI with engaging user experiences is more exciting than ever. In my latest project, I developed an interactive quiz app inspired by the legendary quiz show format—though not naming it directly—to create a unique experience. The app, dubbed the KBK-Inspired Quiz App using Whisper AI, leverages OpenAI’s Whisper AI for speech recognition and Gradio for a sleek, web-based interface. This project demonstrates how AI can be woven into interactive applications to deliver both fun and educational experiences.

Overview
The quiz app challenges users with a series of 10 questions covering topics such as artificial intelligence, computer science, physics, and even some regional themes. Each question is presented with four answer options, and the app listens to your spoken responses, transcribes them using Whisper AI, and provides immediate feedback—both visually and through synthesized audio.

A special “secret question” is hidden behind an additional button, offering a playful twist with a higher prize for a correct answer. Although the secret question is presented in Roman Urdu, the main questions are in English, ensuring the app is both accessible and intriguing.

Key Features
Advanced Speech Recognition:
The app uses Whisper AI to accurately transcribe spoken answers in real time. Users simply record their response, and the app processes it instantly, removing the need for manual input.

Dynamic Audio Feedback:
By integrating gTTS and pydub, the app provides immediate audio feedback using a deep, authoritative male voice that is both fast-paced and engaging. Whether you answer correctly or incorrectly, you receive clear verbal feedback on your performance.

Interactive Web Interface with Gradio:
Gradio makes it easy to build a responsive and intuitive user interface. The app includes clearly defined sections for starting the quiz, recording answers, and navigating between questions. A progress indicator at the top shows your cumulative "money earned"—a playful scoring system where each correct answer adds 10 rupees, and each incorrect answer deducts 10 rupees.

Hidden Challenge – The Secret Question:
For an extra twist, a hidden question is available that challenges users with a fun, Roman Urdu prompt. Answering this question correctly awards a higher prize, adding an element of surprise and excitement.

Technical Implementation
This project is built entirely in Python and uses several powerful libraries:

Whisper AI:
For state-of-the-art speech recognition, enabling the app to handle natural spoken language input with ease.

Gradio:
To create an interactive web-based interface that is accessible from any browser. Gradio simplifies the process of integrating AI models with user-friendly UI components.

gTTS and pydub:
These libraries work in tandem to convert text to speech and to process the resulting audio. Adjustments to pitch and speed create a distinct, deep male voice that enhances the quiz experience.

Custom Scoring System:
The scoring mechanism is integrated into the application logic. Users earn or lose “rupees” based on their answers, and the updated score is prominently displayed on the interface.

Deployment and Future Directions
While the app currently runs locally, it can be deployed to cloud platforms such as Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Sharing for persistent access. Deploying the app online ensures that the shareable link remains active even when your local machine is off.

Looking ahead, future enhancements might include expanding the question bank, incorporating additional interactive features, and refining the voice synthesis further. This project not only serves as a proof-of-concept but also opens the door for more sophisticated applications that blend AI with interactive user experiences.

Conclusion
The KBK-Inspired Quiz App using Whisper AI is a testament to the innovative potential at the intersection of artificial intelligence and interactive design. By combining Whisper AI’s powerful transcription capabilities with Gradio’s versatile interface, I have created an engaging quiz experience that is both educational and entertaining. This project provided invaluable hands-on experience with modern AI tools and web interface development, and it represents a significant step forward in creating immersive, AI-driven applications.
